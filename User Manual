Introduction:
This manual will describe in detail the operation and general setup of the simulation of a monorail emulator using the AVR microprocessor board. To run the configuration, open the project in AVR Studio, build the project and run the .hex file using Arduino.
Wiring Configuration:
Component	Function	Wiring
Motor Configuration	Spin to simulate monorail engine	OpO - +5V (P11)
OpE  - RDX3 (Port D)
Mot - POT (Input) 
Keypad 	Read in number and alphabet	(Port L) PL3-0– C0-3
PL7-4 – R0-3  
LCD 	Display info on LCD	BE – PA4 (Port A)
RW – PA5
E – PA6
RS – PA7
(LCD Data) D0-7 – PF0-7 (Port F)
LED 		
Push Buttons		
Operation
1.	Enter number of stations (maximum 10) to visit using the keypad. Alphabet will not be recognized
2.	Enter Station names. To input letter, select number key with corresponding letter, then select the position of the letter. For example, if letter ‘C’ is required, select number 2, and then select the letter C on the right side of the keyboard, indicating the 3rd letter of keypad 2. To print whitespace, press ‘1’ + ‘A’. To indicate end of string, press ‘*’
3.	Continue entering station names
4.	Enter a number to indicate time from each station (maximum of 10 seconds), if time exceeds 10 seconds, error message will occur
5.	Enter a number to indicate stop time of monorail
6.	Message will appear, indicating completion of configuration and time of monorail simulation
Displays
There will be 2 separate displays to follow; LED and LCD
The LCD screen will be where user inputs information about monorail route.
The LED screen will be for aesthetics for Hasindu. REMEMBER TO CHANGE THIS PART
Modes:
The monorail will run in 5 modes:
•	Enter number of stations
•	Enter name of stations
•	Enter time between stations
•	Enter stop time at stations
•	Running of simulation
5.1 Number of stations:
When the monorail system is started up, user will be asked for the number of stations. Keypad will only recognize numbers.

5.2 Name of Stations:
Enter names of stations: Numbers will not be recognised

1st alpha position of number
2nd alpha position of number
3rd alpha position of number
-	‘1’ + A = Whitespace



For example, we want to type the letter K, we first press 5 as K is assigned to that number, then we press B to indicate we want the letter in the 2nd position:










To print a white space: 1 + A

Dhere will be 5 different displays within the LCD Display:
1.	Please type the maximum number stations: x
2.	Please type the name of Station x: xxxxxxx
3.	The time from Station x to Station y is: x
4.	The stop time of the monorail at any station is: x
5.	Now the configuration is complete. Please wait for x seconds
However, there will also be error message displays:
1.	Error! Maximum number of stations is 10
2.	Incorrect! The time from Station x to Station y is: 10
